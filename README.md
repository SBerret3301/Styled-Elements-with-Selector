Explanation:

1. `p ~ span`: This CSS selector targets any `<span>` element that comes after a `<p>` element. The styles are then applied to these selected `<span>` elements.

   - `color: aqua;`: Sets the text color of the selected `<span>` elements to aqua.

The HTML document contains a mixture of `<span>`, `<p>`, and `<code>` elements. The styles specified in the CSS section apply to `<span>` elements that come after `<p>` elements. The comments in the code provide explanations for each section.
